# The Writer's Block
The Writer’s Block is a social media app built on a PERN stack (React, NodeJs, and PostgresSQL). It’s branded toward writers and other creative artists. Users can create an account, post stories, and follow other users.  

After completing a course on PostgresSQL, I wanted to see how an SQL database interacts with React and NodeJs. This project gave me the opportunity to design an SQL database and integrate it with React and NodeJs. 

Another goal for this project was to write code that is easier to read and maintain.
