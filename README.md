# The Writer's Block

The Writer’s Block is a social media app, built on a PERN stack(react, nodeJs, and PostgresSQL). It’s branded towards writers or other creative artists. Users can create an account, post stories, and follow other users.  

After completing a course on Postgres SQL, I wanted to see how an SQL database interacts with React and NodeJs. This project gave me the opportunity to design a SQL database and integrate it with React and NodeJs. 

Another goal for this project was to write code that is easier to read and maintain.
